# VR-GAN - visualization for regression with a generative adversarial network
This code reproduces part of the results presented in the paper [Adversarial regression training for visualizing the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with chest x-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10468), presented at MICCAI 2019 ([poster](https://ricbl.github.io/files/miccai2019_poster.pdf)). This code implementation is done in PyTorch and was partially inspired by [Orobix VAGAN code](https://github.com/orobix/Visual-Feature-Attribution-Using-Wasserstein-GANs-Pytorch). 

The VR-GAN algorithm can be used to assess how a chest x-ray would change with different severities of a disease like COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). In abstract terms, it provides a visualization of the expected changes in an input image x when an associated regression value y is changed to y'. It uses a generator G to output a difference map Δx that is summed to the original x to produce a modified image x'. A regressor R is used to guide the learning for G, and both are adversarially trained.

The code present here uses a synthetic dataset as proof of concept of the algorithm. In this synthetic dataset, disease severity is associated with the size of the side of a square in a noisy image.  We are going to try to provide a model pre-trained on chest x-rays in the future, depending on release approval. The chest x-ray dataset used to train this model is not publically available, and there are no plans of making it available in the future.

**Note:** This branch was not tested for the same results as the paper, so results may differ slightly.

## Setup

The first run of the code will automatically generate the synthetic dataset. 

To install all the needed libraries, you can use the requirements.txt file. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you want to install them with pip.

## Usage

You can train the model on the synthetic dataset using:

`python train.py --experiment=my_toy_training`

To run scoring on the test set, run:

`python train.py --nepochs=1 --split_validation=test --skip_train=true --load_checkpoint_g=<path_to_a_checkpoint_to_load> --experiment=my_toy_testing`

You can run `python train.py --help` to see all available options for modifying the training script.

## Outputs
All the outputs of the model are saved in the runs folder, inside a folder for the specific experiment you are running (\<experiment name\>\_\<timestamp\>). These are the files that are saved:
  * tensorboard/events.out.tfevents.<...>: tensorboard file for following the training losses and validation score in real-time and for checking their evolution through the epochs.
  * real_samples: a fixed batch of validation examples for which outputs will be printed
  * delta_x_gt.png: ground truth for the delta_x (disease effect map, or difference map) of the fixed set of validation examples
  * real_samples_desired.txt: the desired PFT values for each of the fixed validation images
  * real_samples_gt.txt: the original PFT values for each of the fixed validation images
  * delta_x_samples_\<epoch\>.png: delta_x output of the generator at the end of that epoch for the fixed set of examples
  * xprime_samples_\<epoch\>: modified input image (sum of original image and delta_x) at the end of that epoch for the fixed set of examples
  * generator_state_dict_\<epoch\>: checkpoint for the generator model
  * regressor_state_dict_\<epoch\>: checkpoint for the regressor model
  * log.txt: a way to check the configurations used for that run and to check the losses and scores of the model in text format, without loading tensorboard.

## Results
The model gets a normalized cross-correlation with the ground-truth delta around 0.85 in the validation set in about 10 epochs of training. After choosing the best validation epoch, the same model should be able to get the same score for the test set.

These are the kinds of results you can expect (each image below shows 20 input/output examples in a 4x5 grid):

Input image (x) |  Desired change (Δx ground truth)  |  Produced change (Δx)  | Modified image (x')
--- | --- | --- | ---
